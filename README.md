# Stackforge CLI

Professional fullstack project generator with FastAPI + React or Express + Vue, supporting multiple databases and container deployment with Podman or Docker.

## Installation

Install the CLI globally from npm:

```sh
npm install -g stackforge-cli
```

## Quick Usage

Create a new project interactively:

```sh
stackforge create
```

Or skip questions and use default values:

```sh
stackforge create --skip-questions
```

### Main Options

- `--with-podman` Automatically starts the project with podman-compose after generation.
- `--skip-questions` Uses default configuration without interactive prompts.

## What does it generate?

- FastAPI (Python) or Express (Node.js) backend, both with example CRUD, optional JWT authentication, and support for SQLite, Postgres, MySQL, or MongoDB
- React (Vite) or Vue (Vite) frontend, with login example, CRUD, and protected route consumption
- Configuration files for local development and containers (Podman/Docker)
- `.gitignore` and professional structure for each stack part

## Requirements

- Node.js 20.19+ (for frontend creation with Vite)
- Podman and podman-compose (optional, only if you use `--with-podman`)
- Python 3.10+ (for backend)

## Example workflow

```sh
# 1. Create the project
stackforge create

# 2. Enter the generated folder
cd my-project

# 3. (Optional) Start everything with Podman
podman-compose up --build

# 4. Access backend at http://localhost:8000 and frontend at http://localhost:5173
```

## Customization

### Advanced customization

When creating a project, you can choose:

- **Stack**: FastAPI + React or Express + Vue
- **Database**: SQLite, Postgres, MySQL, or MongoDB
  - For SQLite, no extra info is required
  - For Postgres/MySQL: host, port, user, password, and database name
  - For MongoDB: you can enter a full URI or provide details separately
- **JWT Authentication**: include or skip an authentication example
- **Frontend**: use the official Vite installer or the base template

> **Note:** The generator creates `.env` files and ready-to-use requirements/configs for each stack and database.
